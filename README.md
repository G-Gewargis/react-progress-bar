# React Progress Bar

This repository contains a simple project I built to practice and better understand React. It’s not intended for production or as a guide, just a personal learning exercise.

## Project Overview

This app is a basic implementation of a progress bar, meant to help me get more hands-on with React concepts like components, props, state, and event handling. It’s not designed to be a reusable package or reference. 

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the progress bar.
- **HTML**: The markup language used to structure the web pages.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive progress bar component.
- Easy to integrate and customize.
- Basic styling with CSS.
